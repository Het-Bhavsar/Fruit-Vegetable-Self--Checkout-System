Developed a Fruit & Vegetable Detection Convolutional Neural Network using tensorflow 


# Abstract
In todayâ€™s world, time has become the most important resource we all have, and no one likes
standing in long queues. Earlier bar-code technology is used for bill generation which takes a lot
of time and can only be read one item individually, which is the major disadvantage and a
time-consuming process. Further, this system is also prone to human error. In order to
overcome these problems and generate a bill within less time, an automatic bill generation
system can be developed using computer vision which displays the price of the chosen grocery
products during bill generation based on the type of item and their size & quantity. Using CNN
(Convolutional Neural Networks) the items can be detected much more easily & efficiently. The
accuracy level of the developed model is 95% and on real world data it provides an accuracy of
90%. Such a system can become the first step towards an automated checkout system.



# Model.Py
File contains model building code and saves model.h5 file to directory

# Fruits_Vegetable_Classification.py 
File contains Frontend Code and uses the model.h5 file to predict fruit & Vegetables
